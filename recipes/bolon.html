    <p>Bolon de verde or simply Bolon, is a mashed green plantain dumplings or balls stuffed with cheese and/or
        chicharrones (can be filled with anything you might enjoy really) and fried until crispy- is another traditional
        Ecuadorian recipe from the
        coastal region.</p>

    <p>This classic Ecuadorian breakfast dish consists of green plantains which are fried over medium heat until very
        tender,
        then mashed into dough, stuffed with cheese or pork, formed into round balls, and then fried again until crispy.
        Bolon
        is a slang term that means large ball, so you could translate the name of this dish as green plantain balls, but
        I think
        green plantain dumpling is probably a better food translation.</p>

    <p>Bolones are often served for breakfast or brunch; they are also a great side dish or good
        appetizers.If you are serving bolon de verde for breakfast or brunch I suggest that you accompany it with hot
        coffee, a
        fried egg, hot sauce, and some tomato or avocado slices.</p>

        <li>5 green plantains</li>
