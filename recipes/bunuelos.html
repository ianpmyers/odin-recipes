    <p>Buñuelos are a lightly fried egg and flour dough with a hint of lemon zest. After frying, they're dusted with
        confectioners' sugar to create an irresistible, bite-sized dessert. They can also be filled with pastry cream,
        egg
        custard, or your favorite marmalade. Making these tasty treats is actually quite easy, so you can explore all
        these

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>gahter all ingrediants (Duh)</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine water, butter, granulated sugar, lemon zest, and pinch of salt. Bring to a
                boil.</li>
            <li>As soon as the water boils, add the flour and baking powder all at once and begin stirring with a wooden
                spoon. Stir
                constantly until the dough begins to come away from the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and allow to cool down for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>When the dough is no longer hot, but still warm, stir in the eggs, one by one. Use a hand mixer if
                necessary
                to ensure
                that the dough is smooth.</li>
            <li>Set aside for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed frying pan, pour vegetable oil to a depth of about 1 1/2 inches. Heat on
                medium-high.</li>
            <li>When the oil is just hot enough to fry, begin dropping spoonfuls of dough into the oil.</li>
            <li>Turn over when the bottom is golden. The buñuelos should turn a golden color and begin to float when
                cooked.
            </li>
            <li>Remove them from the pan one at a time using a slotted spoon or spatula. Drain on a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
