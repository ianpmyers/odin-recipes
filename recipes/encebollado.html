    <h5>A bowl of encebollado soup aka the hangover cure</h5>

    <p>Encebollado is an original dish from the province of Guayas, in southwestern Ecuador, as well as from Manabí. The
        broth that accompanies the fish is made from blended cassava and can be
        seasoned with chili powder, cumin or other spices to taste.</p>

    <p>Encebollado de pescado is one of my favorite soups, the name is hard to translate, and literally it could be
        translated
        as oniony fish soup. Encebollado is made with fresh caught tuna and or mahi-mahi, yuca or cassava root,
        tomatoes, onions, spices and
        is served with curtido or pickled onions and tomatoes on top or mixed in with the soup. Locals are often seen
        smashing a handful of plantain chips into their soup (highly recommended) The pickled or lime marinated
        red onions are what give it the name “encebollado”. It is a typical soup from the coastal region in Ecuador.
    </p>

    <p>In fact it is known as the best hangover cure (like so many other Ecuadorian dishes); and restaurants that
        specialize in
        encebollado begin serving it in the early morning.</p>
